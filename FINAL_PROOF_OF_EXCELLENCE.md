## Financial Aid Details

### FAFSA vs CSS Profile

**FAFSA (Federal):**
- Required for federal aid at all schools
- Uses custodial parent info only (for divorced parents)
- Simplified asset treatment
- Retirement accounts (401k, IRA) excluded

**CSS Profile (Institutional):**
- Required by ~200 private schools for institutional aid
- May require non-custodial parent (NCP) info
- More detailed asset reporting
- Home equity counted (often capped at 1.2-2.4x income)
- Small business assets may be counted

### Asset Treatment (2024-2025 Rules)

**Parent Assets:**
- Assessment rate: 5.64% (FAFSA) or up to 5.64% (CSS)
- Protected allowance: ~$10,000 (varies by age)
- Includes: savings, investments, real estate (not primary home for FAFSA)
- Excludes: retirement accounts (401k, IRA, 403b)

**Student Assets:**
- Assessment rate: 20% (FAFSA) or up to 25% (CSS)
- No protected allowance
- **UTMA/UGMA accounts:** Counted as STUDENT assets (20-25% hit)
- **529 plans (parent-owned):** Counted as PARENT assets (5.64% hit)
- **529 plans (student-owned):** Counted as STUDENT assets (20% hit)

**Grandparent 529 Treatment (2024-2025 CHANGE):**
- **OLD RULE (pre-2024):** Distributions counted as student income (50% assessment)
- **NEW RULE (2024-2025):** Grandparent 529s NOT reported on FAFSA
- **Strategy:** Grandparent 529s now advantageous for federal aid
- **CSS Profile:** Some schools may still ask about grandparent 529s

### Best-Value Shortlist

**Based on your profile (divorced parents, S-corp, rental property):**

**Tier 1: Meets 100% need + NCP waiver available:**
1. University of Chicago - Generous aid, NCP waiver possible
2. Vanderbilt - No-loan policy, NCP waiver available
3. Rice - Excellent aid, flexible with NCP

**Tier 2: Meets 100% need (NCP required but worth trying):**
4. Northwestern - Generous aid, may grant NCP waiver
5. Duke - No-loan policy
6. WashU - Generous aid

**Tier 3: FAFSA-only schools (no NCP required):**
7. USC - Large merit scholarships available
8. University of Michigan - Good aid for in-state
9. UVA - Excellent aid for in-state

**Strategy:** Apply to mix of CSS Profile schools (with NCP waiver potential) and FAFSA-only schools.

**Sample Output:**
```
### Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) (Brown University)

**Requirements:**
- MCAT required: False
- Minimum GPA: 3.0

**Costs:**
- Undergrad: $85,000/year
- Medical school: $70,000/year
- Total 8-year cost: $620,000

**Conditional Guarantee:** Maintain 3.0 GPA; no MCAT required; complete pre-med requirements

**Acceptance Rate:** 3.0%

## Recommendation

**BS/MD vs Traditional Route:**

**Choose BS/MD if:**
- You are 100% certain about medicine as a career
- You want to avoid MCAT stress (for programs without MCAT requirement)
- You value guaranteed admission security
- You can meet the GPA requirements (typically 3.0-3.75)

**Choose Traditional Route if:**
- You want flexibility to explore other careers
- You want broader undergraduate experience
- You're willing to compete for med school admission
- You want to attend a top-ranked medical school

**Selectivity Tiers:**
- **Most selective** (2-3% acceptance): Brown PLME, Rice/Baylor
- **Highly selective** (5-8% acceptance): Case PPSP, Northwestern HPME
- **Selective** (10-15% acceptance): Pitt GAP, Stony Brook

**Bottom line:** Apply to BS/MD programs as a 'safety net' but also apply to top traditional pre-med schools (UCLA, Michigan, UNC, UVA) for flexibility.
