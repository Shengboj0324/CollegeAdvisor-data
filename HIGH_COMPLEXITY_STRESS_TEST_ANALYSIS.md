## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **Why Did the Model Struggle with High-Complexity Queries?**

1. **Training Data Limitations**
   - Model was trained on 7,888 general college admissions examples
   - **Lacks current 2025 policy data** (FAFSA Simplification Act, new SAI calculations)
   - **Lacks technical policy documents** (ASSIST articulations, NCAA manuals, USCIS guidance)
   - **Lacks institutional-specific data** (school-by-school aid policies, transfer requirements)

2. **No Real-Time Data Access**
   - Cannot access actual URLs or current websites
   - Cannot pull live data from StudentAid.gov, ASSIST.org, Common Data Sets
   - Cannot verify current policies or numbers

3. **Hallucination Risk**
   - When asked for specific data it doesn't have, model fabricates plausible-sounding numbers
   - Examples: CS 105/106 prerequisites, selectivity percentages, TCO calculations
   - **Critical Issue:** Fabricated data is dangerous for college counseling

4. **Insufficient Depth for Technical Queries**
   - Model performs well on general advice (essay writing, personalized counseling)
   - **Struggles with technical requirements** (ASSIST course mapping, NCAA rules, visa regulations)
   - **Lacks structured output capabilities** (tables, decision trees, Gantt charts)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RISKS FOR PRODUCTION USE

### **High-Risk Scenarios:**

1. **Financial Aid Calculations** ⚠️ HIGH RISK
   - Model may provide incorrect SAI/EFC calculations
   - Could mislead families about expected costs
   - **Recommendation:** Do NOT use for financial aid calculations without human verification

2. **Transfer Requirements** ⚠️ HIGH RISK
   - Model may provide incorrect course articulations
   - Could cause students to take wrong courses
   - **Recommendation:** Always verify with ASSIST.org and campus advisors

3. **Immigration/Visa Guidance** ⚠️ HIGH RISK
   - Model may provide outdated OPT/CPT/I-20 information
   - Immigration errors can have serious consequences
   - **Recommendation:** Always verify with ICE/USCIS and international student offices

4. **NCAA Recruiting** ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK
   - Model may provide incorrect NIL or recruiting rules
   - Could jeopardize athletic eligibility
   - **Recommendation:** Always verify with NCAA compliance officers

5. **Admission Statistics** ⚠️ MEDIUM RISK
   - Model may fabricate admit rates or GPA cutoffs
   - Could lead to poor school list decisions
   - **Recommendation:** Always verify with Common Data Sets and official sources

   - Internal transfer GPA cutoffs
   - WUE program exclusions

4. **Improve Structured Output**
   - Train on generating tables
   - Train on decision trees
   - Train on timeline/Gantt charts
   - Train on side-by-side comparisons

5. **Add Source Citation Training**
   - Train on providing specific URLs
   - Train on citing official sources

## 🎯 FINAL VERDICT

### **High-Complexity Query Readiness: ⚠️ NOT READY**

**Summary:**
- ✅ **Handles general queries well** (7.71/10 average on 80 standard questions)
- ⚠️ **Struggles with high-complexity queries** (4.4/10 average on 10 research-heavy questions)
- ❌ **Lacks current policy data and authoritative sourcing**
- ❌ **Risk of data fabrication on technical queries**

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Deploy for general college counseling** (essay writing, personalized advice, strategic planning)
- ⚠️ **Add disclaimers for technical queries** (financial aid, transfer requirements, immigration)
- ❌ **Do NOT use as sole source for high-stakes decisions** (always verify with official sources)
- 🔄 **Plan for future training data improvements** (current policies, technical references, institutional data)

**The model is production-ready for general college counseling but requires significant improvements for research-heavy, policy-specific queries.**
